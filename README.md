# 100DaysOfCode

I'm a fresh university graduated, I completed my bachelor's in science in Computer Science almost 3 months ago.
I did't get on a job search because I had a couple of small goals to focus on so i took a 3-6 months break from anything professionl, funny I know. 

!st twon months I realised that the lack of routine and discipline is doing more bad than good to my overall being and my productivity levels, this challenge 
is to become diciplined at once again and to enhance my programming skills which have been neglected alot lately.
